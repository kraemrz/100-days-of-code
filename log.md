First day of my challenge was to get it started, learning git, github and reading throw the rules. Im not 100% sure I got it right.
I will however continue doing like this and if im doing something wrong, I hope someone will inform me.
This challenge is going to be learning python thrue youtube, hackerrank.com, and various pages like so. I am going to upload what im going thrue and update journal daily. I hope i find 1 hour per day to do this, consider I have a 3 year old and wife :)

Cheers!
